The aim of the project is to create an innovative educational panel along with a robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom, a group of sensors and output devices, and a controlling program accessible directly from the panel. The project combines two rapidly developing fields of science: mechatronics, programming, and computer science./

The innovation in our control panel lies in its adaptability to individual needs through the use of interchangeable elements such as sensors, LEDs, etc. This is achieved by employing special connectors that allow for easy attachment and removal of components. Another innovation is the full modularity of the design, making it easy to transport, assemble, and disassemble the device, as well as slim down unnecessary elements for a specific setup./

The entire system is based on a Raspberry Pi 3 as the controller with raspbian as the operating system, making the replacement of faulty parts a straightforward process./

The controlling program is also groundbreaking, enabling users to program complex operations in a language they are familiar with. As a result, even inexperienced students are able to create their algorithms using a simple syntax in the control program. Users will have full control over the device's actions and will be able to modify the program code using the Python programming language to tailor the device's performance according to their specific requirements./
